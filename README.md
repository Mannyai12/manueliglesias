## Projects 
### Customer Management API

I developed a Customer Data Platform (CDP) API that collects and analyzes data from sales transactions, competitor pricing, and market trends to help businesses optimize their pricing strategies. The API, leveraging FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, was designed to manage customer data, products, and transactions. It implemented CRUD operations with secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. Key features included competitor price monitoring and sales performance analysis. The API featured complex database schemas and relationships to ensure data integrity and optimal performance, with Pydantic used for robust data validation. Extensive API testing was conducted using Postman to ensure reliable, error-free operations and seamless integration. Building the app was moderately challenging, utilizing data aggregation and basic pricing algorithms. As a result, the system improved data management efficiency and overall performance.


### Book Recommendation System

I designed a book recommendation tool capable of handling over 10 million records, leveraging **Python** and integrating machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including TF-IDF and cosine similarity. The tool features NLP pipelines for detailed analysis of book descriptions, utilizing tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. These methods significantly enhanced the accuracy of the system's recommendations. Focused improvements allowed me to solve scalability problems effectively. As a result, the system saw improved user satisfaction and overall efficiency.

### Movie Rating Prediction Model

I developed a movie rating prediction system, overseeing over 700,000 movie records with Google Cloud and Jupyter Notebooks, employing advanced ETL techniques for data optimization. The system, powered by a **Random Forest model**, categorized movies with an R-squared value of 0.35 into Bad, Neutral, and Good, enhancing accuracy through NLP and refined categorization. Key factors influencing ratings were identified, leading to proposed improvements in prediction accuracy and resilience through k-means clustering and neural networks. This project showcases a blend of data science techniques to innovate in movie rating prediction.

### Predictive Credit Card Approval Model

I utilized logistic regression and classification tree methods on a dataset of 690 individuals from Kaggle, achieving an 88% accuracy rate. By employing k-fold cross-validation, the average probability for predicted credit card approvals was enhanced to 70%. The analysis provided crucial insights for financial institutions on risk assessment. It highlighted the significant impact of employment status, income, and credit score on credit card approval probabilities. These findings offer guidance for financial institutions to refine their approval processes effectively.
