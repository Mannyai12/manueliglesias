## Projects 
### Book Recommendation System

I designed a book recommendation tool capable of handling over 10 million records, leveraging **Python** and integrating machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including TF-IDF and cosine similarity. The tool features NLP pipelines for detailed analysis of book descriptions, utilizing tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. These methods significantly enhanced the accuracy of the system's recommendations. Focused improvements allowed me to solve scalability problems effectively. As a result, the system saw improved user satisfaction and overall efficiency.

### Movie Rating Prediction System

I developed a movie rating prediction system, overseeing over 700,000 movie records with Google Cloud and Jupyter Notebooks, employing advanced ETL techniques for data optimization. The system, powered by a **Random Forest model**, categorized movies with an R-squared value of 0.35 into Bad, Neutral, and Good, enhancing accuracy through NLP and refined categorization. Key factors influencing ratings were identified, leading to proposed improvements in prediction accuracy and resilience through k-means clustering and neural networks. This project showcases a blend of data science techniques to innovate in movie rating prediction.

### Predictive Credit Card Approval Model

I utilized logistic regression and classification tree methods on a dataset of 690 individuals from Kaggle, achieving an 88% accuracy rate. By employing k-fold cross-validation, the average probability for predicted credit card approvals was enhanced to 70%. The analysis provided crucial insights for financial institutions on risk assessment. It highlighted the significant impact of employment status, income, and credit score on credit card approval probabilities. These findings offer guidance for financial institutions to refine their approval processes effectively.
